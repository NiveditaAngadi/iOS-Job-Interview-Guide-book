OOPS 
Object Oriented Programming 

OOPs - computer programming model that organizes software design around data or objects, rather than functions and logic. 

An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behaviour. 

The main aim of OOPs is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data 
except that function. 

OOP focuses on  the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. 

Benefits of OOPS 
1. Beneficial for collaborative development, when projects are divided into groups. 
2. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency. 


1. What are the structure of object-oriented programming?

Structure or building blocks of object-oriented programming include the following, 

1. Classes 
2. Objects 
3. Methods 
4. Attributes 

2. What are the main principles of OOP?
Object-oriented programming based on the following principles. 

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction 
3. Inheritance 
4. Polymorphism
5. Syntax 
6. Coupling 
7. Association 

3. What is encapsulation?
The encapsulation principle states that all important information is contained inside an object and only select information is exposed. 
The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined class.
