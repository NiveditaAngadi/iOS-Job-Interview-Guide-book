iOS Mobile Device Management (MDM) is a software tool, that allows businesses and IT teams to remotely monitor and manage iOS devices. 
MDM can help businesses manage their iOS devices more efficiently and securely.

Here are some things that iOS MDM can do:
- Securely configure devices: MDM allows users to wirelessly configure devices by sending commands and profiles to the device. 
- Manage apps, accounts, and data: MDM can configure apps, accounts, and data on each device. 
- Enforce passwords and policies: MDM can enforce passwords and policies on devices. 
- Remove apps when an employee leaves: MDM can remove apps deployed through the software when an employee leaves the company. 

iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS 10, or later, and visionOS 1.1 or later, have a built-in framework that supports mobile device management (MDM).
MDM lets you securely and wirelessly configure devices by sending profiles and commands to the device, whether they’re owned by the user or your organisation.

Mobile Device Management (MDM) is a framework provided by Apple, that allows organizations to securely manage and configure devices such as iPhones, iPads, and Macs. 
It enables IT administrators to control device settings, deploy apps, enforce security policies, and remotely manage enrolled devices.

Steps to Achieve MDM via Apple Technology

	1.	Set Up an MDM Server:
  	•	Use an Apple-approved MDM solution, such as Jamf, Workspace ONE, or Microsoft Intune.
	2.	Integrate with Apple Business Manager:
	  •	Register devices in Apple Business Manager to enable Automated Device Enrollment.
	3.	Enroll Devices:
  	•	Use Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) for zero-touch deployment or manual enrollment for BYOD (Bring Your Own Device).
	4.	Create Configuration Profiles:
  	•	Define settings (e.g., Wi-Fi, email accounts, restrictions) using the MDM solution.
  	•	Deploy profiles to enrolled devices.
	5.	Issue Commands:
  	•	Use the MDM solution to send commands (e.g., wipe device, push apps) to enrolled devices.
	6.	Manage Apps and Content:
	  •	Use the Volume Purchase Program (VPP) to purchase and distribute apps in bulk.
	  •	Configure app settings and restrict data sharing.
