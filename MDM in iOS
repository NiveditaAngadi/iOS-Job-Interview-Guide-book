iOS Mobile Device Management (MDM) is a software tool 
that allows businesses and IT teams to remotely monitor and manage iOS devices. 
MDM can help businesses manage their iOS devices more efficiently and securely.

Here are some things that iOS MDM can do:
- Securely configure devices: MDM allows users to wirelessly configure devices by sending commands and profiles to the device. 
- Manage apps, accounts, and data: MDM can configure apps, accounts, and data on each device. 
- Enforce passwords and policies: MDM can enforce passwords and policies on devices. 
- Remove apps when an employee leaves: MDM can remove apps deployed through the software when an employee leaves the company. 

iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS 10, or later, and visionOS 1.1 or later, have a built-in framework that supports mobile device management (MDM).

MDM lets you securely and wirelessly configure devices by sending profiles and commands to the device, whether theyâ€™re owned by the user or your organisation.
