RxSwift 

1. What is Rx? 
Rx is a generic abstraction of computation expressed through Observable<Element> interface, which lets you broadcast and subscribe to values and other events 
from an Observable stream. 

2. What is "Generic abstraction of Computation" ?
Generic abstraction of Computation refers to the concept of representing computational processes in a way that focuses on the essential, high-level 
operations and hides the underlying details of implementation, allowing same concept to be applied across different computing scenarios without needing 
to rewrite code for each specific context. 

It's about creating a general model of computation that can be used to describe a wide variety of computing tasks without being tied to any specific hardware 
or programming language. 

3. What is RxSwift?
RxSwift is the library, Swift-specific implementation of the Reactive Extensions standard. 
RxSwift's intention is to enable easy composition of asynchronous operations and streams of data in the form of Observable objects and a suite of methods to
transform and compose these pieces of asynchronous work. 

Its a library for composing asynchronous and event-based code by using observable sequences and functional style operators. 
RxSwift, in its essence, simplifies developing asynchronous programs by allowing your code to react to new data and process it in a sequential, isolated manner.

4. Why RxSwift?
Rx enables building apps in a declarative way. 

Writing a asynchronous code, that truly runs in parallel, however, is rather complex, especially when different bits of code need to be to work 
with the same pieces of data. 
It's hard to argue about which piece of code updates the data first, or which code read the latest value. 

Apple provides many API's which helps to run code asynchronously. 
1. Notification Center 
2. The delegate pattern
3. Grand Central Dispatch 
4. Closures

Since most of code would perform some work asynchronously, and all UI events are inherently asynchronous, it's impossible to make assumptions in what 
order the entirety of your app code will get executed. 

App's code, runs differently on various conditions/ external factors, such as user input, network activity, or other OS events. 
Each time when user fires up the app, the code may run in a completely different order depending on those external factors. 

Using delegates requires you to adopt one particular pattern, another one for closures,
yet another approach for subscribing to NotificationCenter, and so on. Since there is
no universal language across all the asynchronous APIs, reading and understanding the
code, and reasoning about its execution, becomes difficult.

Some of the core issues with writing asynchronous code are, 
1. the order in which pieces of work are performed. 
2. shared mutable data

5. What is State?
State is the way software behaves at particular point in time based on its input and external factors.
Managing state in your app, especially when shared between multiple asynchronous components is cumbersome process. 

6. What is imperative programming?
Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements to change the program's state. 
You use imperative code to tell the app exactly when and how to do things. 

It gets challenging for humans to write imperative code for complex, asynchronous apps especially when shared mutable state is involved. 

7. What is side effects?
Side effects represent any changes to the state outside of your code's current scope. 

The important aspect of producing side effects is doing so in a controlled way. 
You need to be able to determine which pieces of code cause side effects, and which simply process and output data. 

8. How RxSwift helps in handling the state changes in asynchronous code?
RxSwift tries to address the issues by 
- Declarative code - lets you define pieces of behaviour. RxSwift will run these behaviours any time there's a relevant event and provide an immutable, isolated
pieces of data to work with. 

RxSwift tackles mutable state, it allows you to compose event sequences 
and improves on architectural concepts such as code isolation, reusability, and decoupling.

RxSwift finds the sweet spot between traditionally imperative Cocoa code and purist
functional code. It allows you to react to events by using immutable code definitions to
process asynchronous pieces of input in a deterministic, composable way.

9. What is Reactive systems?
Reactive systems is rather abstract term and covers web or iOS apps that exhibit most of all of the following qualities,

1. Responsive: Keep UI upto date and represents the latest app state. 
2. Resilient: Each behaviour defined in isolation and provides for flexible error recovery. 
3. Elastic: The code handles varied workload, often implementing features such as lazy pull-driven data collections, event throttling, and resource sharing. 
4. Message driven: Components use message-based communication for improved reusability and isolation, decoupling the lifecycle and implementation of classes.

10. What are the building blocks of RxSwift?
Observables
Operators 
Schedulers 

11. What is Observables?
The "Observable<T>" class provides the foundation of Rx code - the ability to asynchronously produce a sequence of events that can 
"carry" an immutable snapshot of generic data of type T. 
In the simplest words, it allows other objects or consumers to subscribe for events, or values, emitted by another object over time. 

The "Observable<T>" class allows one or more observers to react to any events in real time and update the app's UI, or otherwise process and utilize 
new and incoming data. 

The "Observable" protocol - to which Observable<T> conforms is simple, An Observable can emit(and observers can receive) only three types of events. 

1. A next event -> An event that "carries" the latest (or "next") data value. 
An Observable may emit an indefinite amount of these values, until a terminating event is emitted. 

2. A completed event -> This event terminates the event sequence with success. It means the Observable completed its life cycle successfully and won't 
emit additional events. 

3. An error event -> The Observable terminates with an error and will not emit additional events. 

This simple contract of three possible events an observable can emit is anything and everything in Rx. Because is so universal, you can use it to create 
event the most complex app logic. 

You don't ever need to use delegate protocols or to inject closures to allow your classes to talk to each other. 

12. There are two kind of Observable Sequences 
1. Finite  - Some observable sequences emit zero, one or more values, and, at a later point, either
terminate successfully or terminate with an error. In iOS download file from an internet.
2. Infinite - Some activities are supposed to terminate either naturally or forcefully, there are other sequences which are simply infinite. 
Often UI events are such infinite observable sequences. 
For example - Code reacts as per device orientation changes.
